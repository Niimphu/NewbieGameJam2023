# Scorched

In my first Game Jam, I created a small prototype for a platform game set in a sun-scorched future.
I created placeholder and concept art for the project and programmed the game logic, and teamed up with [PolyBytes](https://github.com/PolyBytes) who also worked on the code, as well as providing help with shaders.

The main mechanic behind this game is that the play has an umbrella which can be used as protection from the sun and to reduce fall speed, but it is also their weapon to defeat enemies, and must be toggled between the two modes.

The demo level can be played over on [itch.io](https://nimphu.itch.io/scorched)
